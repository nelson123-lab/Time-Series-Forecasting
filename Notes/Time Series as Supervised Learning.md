## Time Series as Supervised learning

- Supervised learning is the most popular way of framing problems for machine learning as a collection of observations with inputs and outputs.
- Sliding window is the way to restructure a time series dataset as a supervised learning problem.
- Multivariate and multi-step forecasting time series can also be framed as supervised learning using the sliding window method.
